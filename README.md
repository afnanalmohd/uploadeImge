# The Garage Services Application


<br>

At  **The Garage** technology company, our primary goal is to innovate technological solutions to address our team's challenges. To this end, we're currently developing an application to manage meeting room bookings within our building.
 Additionally, we're creating a community platform to foster connections among our company members.

<br>

**The Garage Services Application** was completed by <a href="https://thegarage.sa">TheGarage</a> development team. Additionally ,The primary objective of writing 
content is to ensure it results in clean code that is easy to read, maintain, understand, and modify by following a structured and consistent format.
<br>
<br>
- For the frontend of our mobile application, we built it using <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install"> Flutter</a>.
The team used <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/get">Getx</a> framework for state management.

- On the backend side, our team is building scalable and efficient backend systems to support our applications using the <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/">Python</a> programming language.
